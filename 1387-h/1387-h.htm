    <h2>
      MOTHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      When handsome young Richard Field&mdash;he was very handsome and very
      young&mdash;announced to our assembled company that if his turn should
      really come to tell us a story, the story should be no invention of his
      fancy, but a page of truth, a chapter from his own life, in which himself
      was the hero and a lovely, innocent girl was the heroine, his wife at once
      looked extremely uncomfortable. She changed the reclining position in
      which she had been leaning back in her chair, and she sat erect, with a
      hand closed upon each arm of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you think that it is right of you to tell any
      one, even friends, anything that you have never yet confessed to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel,&rdquo; replied Richard, &ldquo;although I cannot promise that you will be
      entirely proud of my conduct when you have heard this episode of my past,
      I do say that there is nothing in it to hurt the trust you have placed in
      me since I have been your husband. Only,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I hope that I shall
      not have to tell any story at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes you will!&rdquo; we all exclaimed together; and the men looked eager
      while the women sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of us were much older than Richard, we were middle-aged, in fact;
      and human nature is so constructed, that when it is at the age when making
      love keeps it busy, it does not care so much to listen to tales of others&rsquo; 
      love-making; but the more it recedes from that period of exuberance, and
      ceases to have love adventures of its own, the greater become its hunger
      and thirst to hear about this delicious business which it can no longer
      personally practice with the fluency of yore. It was for this reason that
      we all yearned in our middle-aged way for the tale of love which we
      expected from young Richard. He, on his part, repeated the hope that by
      the time his turn to tell a story was reached we should be tired of
      stories and prefer to spend the evening at the card tables or in the music
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were a house party, no brief &ldquo;week-end&rdquo; affair, but a gathering whose
      period for most of the guests covered a generous and leisurely ten days,
      with enough departures and arrivals to give that variety which is
      necessary among even the most entertaining and agreeable people. Our
      skilful hostess had assembled us in the country, beneath a roof of New
      York luxury, a luxury which has come in these later days to be so much
      more than princely. By day, the grounds afforded us both golf and tennis,
      the stables provided motor cars and horses to ride or drive over admirable
      roads, through beautiful scenery that was embellished by a magnificent
      autumn season. At nightfall, the great house itself received us in the
      arms of supreme comfort, fed us sumptuously, and after dinner ministered
      to our middle-aged bodies with chairs and sofas of the highest
      development.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan devised by our hostess, Mrs. Davenport, that a story should be
      told by one of us each evening, had met with courtesy, but not I with
      immediate enthusiasm. But Mrs. Davenport had chosen her guests with her
      usual wisdom, and after the first experiment, story telling proved so
      successful that none of us would have readily abandoned it. When the time
      had come for Richard Field to entertain the company with the promised tale
      from his life experience, his hope of escaping this ordeal had altogether
      vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Field, it had been noticed as early as breakfast time, was inclined
      to be nervous on her husband&rsquo;s account. Five years of married life had not
      cured her of this amiable symptom, and she made but a light meal. He, on
      the other hand, ate heartily and without signs of disturbance. Apparently
      he was not even conscious of the glances that his wife so frequently stole
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do at least have some omelet, my dear,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Davenport
      urgently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Field could summon no appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are anxious about him,&rdquo; Mrs. Davenport continued after
      breakfast. &ldquo;You are surely not afraid his story will fail to interest us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be that he has given up the one he expected to tell us and can
      think of no other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; he is going to tell that one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t like his choice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t tell me what it is!&rdquo; Mrs. Davenport put down her embroidery.
      &ldquo;Then, Ethel,&rdquo; she laid with severity, &ldquo;the fault is yours. When I had
      been five years married, Mr. Davenport confided everything to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So does Richard. Except when I particularly ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is, Ethel. You let him see that you want to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do want to know. Richard has had such interesting experiences, so
      many of them. And I do so want him to tell a thoroughly nice one. There&rsquo;s
      the one when he saved a man from drowning just below our house, the second
      summer, and the man turned out to be a burglar and broke into the pantry
      that very night, and Richard caught him in the dark with just as much
      courage as he had caught him in the water and just as few clothes, only it
      was so different. Richard makes it quite thrilling. And I mentioned
      another to him. But he just went on shaving. And now he has gone out
      walking, and I believe it&rsquo;s going to be something I would rather not hear.
      But I mean to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At lunch Mrs. Field made a better meal, although it was clear to Mrs.
      Davenport that Richard on returning from his walk had still kept his
      intentions from Ethel. &ldquo;She does not manage him in the least,&rdquo; Mrs.
      Davenport declared to the other ladies, as Ethel and Richard started for
      an afternoon drive together. &ldquo;She will not know anything more when she
      brings him back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But in this Mrs. Davenport did wrong to Ethel&rsquo;s resources. The young wife
      did know something more when she brought her husband back from their drive
      through the pleasant country. They returned looking like an engaged
      couple, rather than parents whose nursery was already a song of three
      little voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has told her,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Davenport at the first sight of them, as
      they entered the drawing-room for an afternoon tea. &ldquo;She does understand
      some things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when after dinner the ladies had withdrawn to the library, and waited
      for the men to finish their cigars, Mrs. Davenport spoke to Ethel. &ldquo;My
      dear, I congratulate you. I saw it at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he hasn&rsquo;t. Richard hasn&rsquo;t told me anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel! Then what is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him something. I told him that if it was going to be any story
      about&mdash;about something I shouldn&rsquo;t like, I should simply follow it
      with a story about him that he wouldn&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel! You darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, and I said I was sure you would all listen, even though I was
      not an author myself. And I have it ready, you know, and it&rsquo;s awfully like
      Richard, only a different side of him from the burglar one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear, what did he do when you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This enquiry was, however, cut short by the entrance of the men. And from
      the glance that came from Richard&rsquo;s eyes as they immediately sought out
      his wife, Mrs. Davenport knew that he could not have done anything very
      severe to Ethel when she made that threat to him during their drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard at once made his way to the easy-chair arranged each night in a
      good position for the narrator of the evening, and baptised &ldquo;The
      Singstool&rdquo; by Mr. Graves. Mr. Graves was an ardent Wagnerian, and
      especially devoted to The Mastersingers of Nuremberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we have,&rdquo; he whispered to Mr. Hillard, &ldquo;a Beckmesser fiasco
      to-night, or will it be a Walter success?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Hillard, besides being an author and a critic, cared little for
      the too literary cleverness of Mr. Graves. He therefore heavily crushed
      that gentleman&rsquo;s allusion to Wagner&rsquo;s opera. &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
      singing contest between Beckmesser and Walter, and I doubt if we are to be
      afflicted with anything so dull in this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard had settled himself in the easy-chair, and was looking
      thoughtfully at various objects in the room, while the small-talk was
      subsiding around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Field,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davenport, &ldquo;you look as if you could find
      nothing to suggest your story to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;it is the number of things that suggest
      it. This newspaper here, that has arrived since I was last in the room,
      has a column which reminds me very forcibly of the experience that I have
      selected to tell you. But I think the most appropriate of all is that
      picture.&rdquo; He pointed to the largest picture on the wall. &ldquo;&lsquo;Breaking Home
      Ties&rsquo; is its title, I remember very well. It is a replica of the original
      that drew such crowds in the Art Building at the World&rsquo;s Fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Richard was saying this, his wife had possessed herself of the
      newspaper, and he now observed how eagerly she was scanning its pages. &ldquo;It
      is the financial column, Ethel, that recalls my story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethel, after a hopeless glance at this, resumed her seat near the sofa by
      Mrs. Davenport.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were many paintings,&rdquo; continued Richard, &ldquo;in that Art Building, of
      merit incomparably greater than &lsquo;Breaking Home Ties&rsquo;; and yet the crowd
      never looked at those, because it did not understand them. But at any hour
      of the day, if you happened to pass this picture, it took you some time to
      do so. You could pass any of John Sargeant&rsquo;s pictures, for instance, at a
      speed limited only by your own powers of running; but you could never run
      past &lsquo;Breaking Home Ties.&rsquo; You had to work your way through the crowd in
      front of that just as you have to do at a fire, or a news office during a
      football game. The American people could never get enough of that mother
      kissing her boy goodbye, while the wagon waits at the open door to take
      him away from her upon his first journey into the world. The idea held a
      daily pathos for them. Many had themselves been through such leave
      takings; and no word so stirs the general heart as the word &lsquo;mother&rsquo;. Song
      writers know this; and the artist knew it when he decided to paint
      &lsquo;Breaking Home Ties.&rsquo; And &lsquo;Mother&rsquo; is the title of my story to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; This was Ethel&rsquo;s bewildered echo, &ldquo;Whose Mother?&rdquo; she softly
      murmured to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard continued. &ldquo;It concerns the circumstances under which I became
      engaged to my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a movement from Ethel as she sat by the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all the circumstances, of course,&rdquo; the narrator continued, with a
      certain guarded candour in his tone. &ldquo;There are certain circumstances
      which naturally attend every engagement between happy and&mdash;and
      devoted&mdash;young people that they keep to themselves quite carefully,
      in spite of the fact that any one who has been through the experience of
      being engaged two or three times&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another movement from Ethel by the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;or even only once, as is my case,&rdquo; the narrator went on, &ldquo;any
      body, I say, who has been through the experience of being engaged only
      once, can form a very correct idea of the circumstances that attend the
      happy engagements of all young people. I imagine they prevail in all
      countries, just as the feeling about &lsquo;mother&rsquo; prevails. Yes, &lsquo;Mother&rsquo; is
      the right title for my story, as you shall see. Is it not strange that if
      you add &lsquo;in-law&rsquo; to the word &lsquo;mother,&rsquo; how immediately the sentiment of
      the term is altered?&mdash;as strongly indeed as when you prefix the word
      &lsquo;step&rsquo; to it. But it is with neither of these composite forms of mother
      that any story deals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel has always maintained that if I had really understood her, it never
      would have happened. She says&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, I&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you shall tell your story afterwards, and I promise to listen
      without a word until you are finished. Mrs. Field says that if I had
      understood her nature as a man ought to understand the girl he has been
      thinking about for several years, I should have known she cared nothing
      about my income.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t care! I&rsquo;d have&rdquo;&mdash;but Mr. Field checked her outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was going to say,&rdquo; said Mr. Field, &ldquo;that had I asked her to marry me
      when I became sure that I wished to marry her, she would have been willing
      to leave New York and go to the waste land in Michigan that was her
      inheritance from a grandfather, and there build a cabin and live in it
      with me; and that while I shot prairie chickens for dinner she would have
      milked the cow which some member of the family would have been willing to
      give us as a wedding present instead of a statue of the Winged Victory, or
      silver spoons and forks, had we so desired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard made a pause here, and looked at his wife as if he expected her to
      correct him. But Ethel was plainly satisfied with his statement, and he
      therefore continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is ideal when a girl is ready to do so much as that for a man.
      But I should not think it ideal in a man to allow the girl he loved to do
      it for him. Nor did I then know anything about the lands in Michigan&mdash;though
      this would have made no difference. Ethel had been accustomed to a house
      several stories high, with hot and cold water in most of them, and
      somebody to answer the door-bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door-bell!&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel. &ldquo;I could have gone without hearing
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Ethel, only to hear the welkin ring would have been enough for you.
      I know that you are sincere in thinking so. And the ringing welkin is all
      we should have heard in Michigan. But the more truly a man loves a girl,
      the less can he bear taking her from an easy to a hard life. I am sure
      that all the men here agree with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur and a nod from the men, and also from Mrs. Davenport.
      But the other ladies gave no sign of assenting to Richard&rsquo;s proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In those days,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I was what in the curt parlance of the street
      is termed a six-hundred-dollar clerk. And though my ears had grown
      accustomed to this appellation, I never came to feel that it completely
      described me. In passing Tiffany&rsquo;s window twice each day (for my habit was
      to walk to and from Nassau Street) I remember that seeing a
      thousand-dollar clock exposed for sale caused me annoyance. Of course my
      salary as a clerk brought me into no unfavourable comparison with the
      clock; and I doubt if I could make you understand my sometimes feeling
      when I passed Tiffany&rsquo;s window that I should like to smash the clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met Ethel frequently in society, dancing with her, and sitting next her
      at dinners. And by the time I had dined at her own house, and walked
      several afternoons with her, my lot as a six-hundred-dollar clerk began to
      seem very sad to me. I wrote verses about it, and about other subjects
      also. From an evening passed with Ethel, I would go next morning to the
      office and look at the other clerks. One of them was fifty-five, and he
      still received six hundred dollars&mdash;his wages for the last thirty
      years. I was then twenty-one; and though I never despaired to the extent
      of believing that years would fail to increase my value to the firm by a
      single cent, still, for what could I hope? If my salary were there and
      then to be doubled, what kind of support was twelve hundred dollars to
      offer Ethel, with her dresses, and her dinners, and her father&rsquo;s carriage?
      For two years I was wretchedly unhappy beneath the many hours of gaiety
      that came to me, as to every young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those two years we could have been in Michigan,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;had you
      understood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. But understanding, I believe that I should do the same again. At
      the office, when not busy, I wrote more poetry, and began also to write
      prose, which I found at the outset less easy. When my first writings were
      accepted (they were four sets of verses upon the Summer Resort) I felt
      that I could soon address Ethel; for I had made ten dollars outside my
      salary. Had she not been in Europe that July, I believe that I should have
      spoken to her at once. But I sent her the paper; and I have the letter
      that she wrote in reply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rdquo;&mdash;began Ethel. But she stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know now that you kept the verses,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;My next
      manuscript, however, was rejected. Indeed, I went on offering my literary
      productions nearly every week until the following January before a second
      acceptance came. It was twenty five dollars this time, and almost made me
      feel again that I could handsomely support Ethel. But not quite. After the
      first charming elation at earning money with my pen, those weeks of
      refusal had caused me to think more soberly. And though I was now bent
      upon becoming an author and leaving Nassau Street, I burned no bridges
      behind me, but merely filled my spare hours with writing and with showing
      it to Ethel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was now that the second area of perturbation of my life came to me. I
      say the second, because the first had been the recent dawning belief that
      Ethel thought about me when I was not there to remind her of myself. This
      idea had stirred&mdash;but you will understand. And now, what was my
      proper, my honourable course? It was a positive relief that at this crisis
      she went to Florida. I could think more quietly. My writing had come to be
      quite often accepted, sometimes even solicited. Should I speak to her, and
      ask her to wait until I could put a decent roof over her head, or should I
      keep away from her until I could offer such a roof? Her father, I
      supposed, could do something for us. But I was not willing to be a
      pensioner. His business&mdash;were he generous&mdash;would be to provide
      cake and butter; but the bread was to be mine and bread was still a long
      way off, according to New York standards. These things I thought over
      while she was in Florida; yet when once I should I find myself with her
      again, I began to fear that I could not hold myself from&mdash;but these
      are circumstances which universal knowledge renders it needless to
      mention, and I will pass to the second perturbation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sum of money was suddenly left me. Then for the first time I understood
      why I had during my boyhood been so periodically sent to see a cross old
      brother of my mother&rsquo;s, who lived near Cold Spring on the Hudson, and whom
      we called Uncle Snaggletooth when no one could hear us. Uncle Godfrey (for
      I have called him by his right name ever since) died and left me what in
      those old days six years ago was still a large amount. To-day we
      understand what true riches mean. But in those bygone times six years ago,
      a million dollars was a sum considerable enough to be still seen, as it
      were, with the naked eye. That was my bequest from Uncle Godfrey, and I
      felt myself to be the possessor of a fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point in Richard&rsquo;s narrative, a sigh escaped from Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he immediately said, &ldquo;that money is always welcome. But it is
      certainly some consolation to reflect how slight a loss a million dollars
      is counted to-day in New York. And I did not lose all of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met Ethel at the train on her return from Florida, and crossed with her
      on the ferry from Jersey City to Desbrosses Street. There I was obliged to
      see her drive away in the carriage with her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Field,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davenport, &ldquo;what hour did that train arrive at
      Jersey City?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard looked surprised. &ldquo;Why, seven-fifteen P. M.,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The
      tenth of March.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dark!&rdquo; Mrs. Davenport exclaimed. &ldquo;Mr. Field, you and Ethel were engaged
      before the ferry boat landed at Desbrosses Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard and Ethel both sat straight up, but remained speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon my interruption,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davenport, smiling. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to
      miss a single point in this story&mdash;do go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard was obliged to burst out laughing, in which Ethel, after a moment,
      followed him, though perhaps less heartily. And as he continued, his blush
      subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my Uncle Godfrey&rsquo;s legacy I was no longer dependent upon my salary,
      or my pen, or my father&rsquo;s purse; and I decided that with the money
      properly invested, I could maintain a modest establishment of my own.
      Ethel agreed with me entirely; and, after a little, we disclosed our plans
      to our families, and they met with approval. This was in April, and we
      thought of October or November for the wedding. It seemed long to wait;
      but it came near being so much longer, that I grow chilly now to think of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I went steadily on with my work at the office in Nassau
      Street, nor did I neglect my writing entirely. My attention, however, was
      now turned to the question of investing my fortune. Just round the corner
      from our office was the firm of Blake and Beverly, Stocks and Bonds.
      Thither my steps began frequently to turn. Mr. Beverly had business which
      brought him every week to the room of our president; and so having a sort
      of acquaintance with him, I felt it easier to consult him than to seek any
      other among the brokers, to which class I was a well nigh total stranger.
      He very kindly consented to be my adviser. I was well pleased to find how
      much I had underrated the interest-bearing capacity of my windfall. &lsquo;Four
      per cent!&rsquo; he cried, when I told him this was the extent of my
      expectations. &lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;re talking like a trustee.&rsquo; And then seeing that
      his meaning was beyond me, he explained in his bluff, humorous manner.
      &lsquo;All a trustee cares for you know, is his reputation for safety. It&rsquo;s not
      his own income he&rsquo;s nursing, and so he doesn&rsquo;t care how small he makes it,
      provided only that his investments would be always called safe. Now there
      are ways of being safe without spending any trouble or time upon it; and
      those are the ways a trustee will take. For example,&rsquo; and here he arose
      and unhooking a file of current quotations from the wall, placed it in my
      lap as I sat beside him. &lsquo;Now here are Government three&rsquo;s selling at 108
      3-8. They are as safe as the United States; and if I advised you to buy
      them, it would cost me no thought, and my character for safety would run
      no risk of a blemish. That is the sort of bond that a trustee recommends.
      But see what income it gives you. Roughly speaking, about twenty-eight
      thousand dollars.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That would not do at all,&rsquo; said I, thinking of Ethel and October.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Certainly not for you,&rsquo; returned Mr. Beverly, gaily. If you were a
      timorous old maid, now, who would really like all her money in her
      stocking in gold pieces, only she&rsquo;s ashamed to say so! But a young fellow
      like you with no responsibility, no wife, and butcher&rsquo;s bill&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      quite another thing!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Quite,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;oh, quite!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; interrupted Ethel, &ldquo;do you have to make yourself out so
      simple?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you forget that I said I should invent nothing, but should keep
      myself to actual experiences. The part of my story that is coming now is
      one where I should be very glad to draw upon my imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Beverly now ran his finger up and down various columns. &lsquo;Here again,&rsquo; 
      said he, &lsquo;is a typical trustee bond, and nets you a few thousand dollars
      more at present prices. New York Central and Hudson River 3 1-2&rsquo;s. Or here
      are West Shore 4&rsquo;s at 113 5-8. But you see it scales down to pretty much
      the same thing. The sort of bond that a trustee will call safe does not
      bring the owner more than about three and one-half per cent.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why, there are some six per cent bonds!&rsquo; I said; and I pointed them out
      to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Selling at 137 7-8, you see,&rsquo; said Mr. Beverly. &lsquo;Deducting the tax,
      there you are scaled down again.&rsquo; He pencilled some swift calculations.
      &lsquo;There,&rsquo; said he. And I nearly understood them. &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;m not here to stop
      your buying that sort of petticoat and canary-bird wafer,&rsquo; continued Mr.
      Beverly. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the regular trustee move, and nobody could criticise you if
      you made it. It&rsquo;s what I call thoughtless safety, and it brings you about
      3 1-2 per cent, as I have already shown you. Anybody can do it.&rsquo; These
      words of Mr. Beverly made me feel that I did not want to do what anybody
      could do. &lsquo;There is another kind of safety which I call thoughtful
      safety,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Thoughtful, because it requires you to investigate
      properties and their earnings, and generally to use your independent
      judgment after a good deal of work. And all this a trustee greatly
      dislikes. It rewards you with five and even six per cent, but that is no
      stimulus to a trustee.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something in me had leaped when Mr. Beverly mentioned six per cent. Again
      I thought of Ethel and October, and what a difference it would be to begin
      our modest housekeeping on sixty instead of forty thousand dollars a year,
      outside of what I was earning. Mr. Beverly now rang a bell. &lsquo;You happen to
      have come,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;on a morning when I can really do something for you
      out of the common. Bring me (it was a clerk he addressed) one of those
      Petunia circulars. Now here you can see at a glance for yourself.&rsquo; He
      began reading the prospectus rapidly aloud to me while I followed its
      paragraphs with my own eye. His strong, well-polished thumb-nail ran
      heavily but speedily down the columns of figures and such words as gross
      receipts, increase of population, sinking fund, redeemable at 105 after
      1920, churned vigorously and meaninglessly through my brain. But I was not
      going to let him know that to understand the circular I should have to
      take it away quietly to my desk in Nassau Street, and spend an hour with
      it alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What is your opinion of Petunia Water sixes?&rsquo; he inquired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;They are a lead-pipe cinch,&rsquo; I immediately answered; and he slapped me
      on the knee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I think!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Anyhow, I have taken 20,000 for mother.
      Do what you like.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh well,&rsquo; said I, delighted at this confidence, I think I can afford to
      risk what you are willing to risk for your mother, Mrs. Beverly. Where is
      Petunia, did you say?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He pulled down a roller map on the wall as you draw down a window-blind,
      and again I listened to statements that churned in my brain. Petunia was a
      new resort on the sea coast of New Hampshire. One railway system did
      already connect it with both Portsmouth and Portland, but it was not a
      very direct connection at present. Yet in spite of this, the population
      had increased 23 and seven-tenths per cent in five years, and now an
      electric railway was in construction that would double the population in
      the next five years. This was less than what had happened to other
      neighbouring resorts under identical conditions; yet with things as they
      now were, the company was earning two per cent on its stock, which was
      being put into improvements. The stock was selling at 30, and if a
      dividend was paid next year, it would go to par. But Mr. Beverly did not
      counsel buying the stock. &lsquo;I did not let mother have any,&rsquo; he said,
      &lsquo;though I took some myself. But the bonds are different. You&rsquo;re getting
      the last that will be sold at par. In three days they will be placed
      before the public at 102 1/2 and interest.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was well pleased when I left Mr. Beverly&rsquo;s office. In a few days I was
      still more pleased to learn that I could sell my Petunia sixes for 104 if
      so wished. But I did not wish it; and Mr. Beverly told me that he should
      not sell his mother&rsquo;s unless they went to 110. &lsquo;In that case,&rsquo; said he,
      &lsquo;it might be worth while to capitalise her premium.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I liked the idea of capitalising one&rsquo;s premium. If you had fifty bonds
      that cost you par, and sold them at 110, you would then buy at par
      fifty-five bonds of some other rising kind, and go on doing this until&mdash;I
      named no limit for this process; but my delighted mind saw visions of
      eighty and a hundred thousand a year&mdash;comfort at least, if not
      affluence in New York&mdash;and I explained to Ethel what the phrase
      capitalising one&rsquo;s premium meant. I showed her the Petunias, too, and we
      read what it said on the coupons aloud together. Ethel was at first not
      quite satisfied with the arrangement of the coupons. &lsquo;Thirty dollars on
      January first, and thirty on July first,&rsquo; she said. That seems a long
      while to wait for those payments, Richard. And there are only two in every
      year, though you pay them a thousand dollars all at once. It does not seem
      very prompt on their part.&rsquo; I told her that this was the rule. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; she
      urged, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you think that a man like Mr. Beverly might be able to get
      them to make an exception if he explained the circumstances? Other people
      may be satisfied with waiting for little crumbs in this way, but why
      should we?&rsquo; I soon made her understand how it was, however, and I
      explained many other facts about investments and the stock market to her,
      as I learned them. It was a great pleasure to do this. We came to talk
      about finance even more than we talked of my writings; for during that
      Spring I invested a good deal more rapidly than I wrote. The Petunias had
      taken only one-twentieth of a million dollars; and though Mr. Beverly
      warned me to rush hastily into nothing, and pointed out the good sense of
      distributing my eggs in a number of baskets, still we both agreed that the
      sooner all my money was bringing me five or six per cent, the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to think that it might be well were women taught the elements
      of investing as they are now taught French and Music. I would not have the
      French and Music dropped, but I would add the other. It might be more of a
      protection to women than being able to read a French novel, and perhaps
      some day we shall have it so. But of course it had been left totally out
      of Ethel&rsquo;s education; and at first she merely received my instruction and
      took my opinions. It was not long, however, before she began to entertain
      some of her own, obliging me not infrequently to reason with her. I very
      well remember the first occasion that this happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had been as usual talking about stocks, as we walked on the Riverside
      Drive on a Sunday afternoon in May. Ethel had been for some moments
      silent. &lsquo;Richard,&rsquo; she finally began, &lsquo;if I had had the naming of these
      things, I should never have called them securities. Insecurities comes a
      great deal nearer what they are. What right has a thing that says on its
      face it is worth a thousand dollars to go bobbing up and down in the way
      most of them do? I think that securities is almost sarcastic. And have you
      noticed the price of those Petunias?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had, of course, noticed it; but I had not mentioned it to Ethel. &lsquo;I
      read the papers now,&rsquo; she explained, &lsquo;morning and evening. Of course the
      market is off a little on account of the bank statement. But that is not
      enough to account for the Petunias.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ethel, you are nervous,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;And it is the papers which make you
      so. The Petunias are a first lien on the whole property, of which the
      assessed valuation&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What is the good,&rsquo; she interrupted, &lsquo;of a first lien on something which
      depends on politics for its existence, if the politicians change their
      minds? Did you not see that bill they&rsquo;re thinking of passing?&rsquo; I was
      startled by what Ethel told me, for the article in the paper had escaped
      my notice. But Mr. Beverly explained it to me in a couple of minutes.
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; he jovially exclaimed, on my entering his office on Monday morning;
      &lsquo;you want to know about Petunias. They opened at 85 I see.&rsquo; He then ran
      the tape from the ticker through his clean strong hands. &lsquo;Here they are
      again. Five thousand sold at 83. Now, if they go to 70, I&rsquo;ll very likely
      take ten thousand more for mother. It&rsquo;s all Frank Smith&rsquo;s bluff, you know.
      He wants a jag of the water-works stock, more than they say they agreed he
      should have. So he&rsquo;s shaking this bill over them, which would allow the
      city to build its own water-plant, and of course run the present company
      out of business. Not a thing in it! All bluff. He&rsquo;ll get the stock, I
      suppose. What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; he broke off to a clerk who came with a message.
      &lsquo;Wants 500 preferred does he? Buyer 30? Very well, he can&rsquo;t have it. Say
      so from me. Now,&rsquo; he resumed to me, &lsquo;take a cigar by the way. And don&rsquo;t
      buy any more Petunias until I tell you the right moment. Do you see where
      your Amalgamated Electric has gone to?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had seen this. It had scored a 20-point rise since my purchase of it;
      and I felt very sorry that I had not taken Mr. Beverly&rsquo;s advice and bought
      a thousand shares. It had been on a day when I had felt unaccountably
      cautious, and I had taken only two hundred and fifty shares of Amalgamated
      Electric. There are days when one is cautious and days when one is
      venturesome; and they seem to have nothing to do with results.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;re going to increase the dividend,&rsquo; said Mr. Beverly, as I smoked
      his excellent cigar. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s good for twenty points higher by the end of the
      week. I had just got mother a few more shares.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left Mr. Beverly&rsquo;s office the possessor of two thousand shares of
      Amalgamated Electric, and also entirely reassured about my Petunias. He
      always made me feel happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His keen laughing brown eyes, and crisp well-brushed hair, and big
      somewhat English way of chaffing (he had gone to Oxford, where he had
      rowed on a winning crew) carried a sense of buoyant prosperity that went
      with his wiry figure and good smart London clothes. His face was almost as
      tawny as an Indian&rsquo;s with the outdoor life that he took care to lead. I
      was always flattered when he could spare any time to clap me on the
      shoulder and crack a joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amalgamated Electric had risen five more points before the board closed
      that afternoon. This was the first news that I told Ethel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Richard,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I wish you would sell that stock to-morrow.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this I saw no reason for; and on Tuesday it had gained seven points
      further. Ethel still more strongly urged me to sell it. I must freely
      admit that.&rdquo; And the narrator paused reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Richard,&rdquo; said Ethel from the sofa. &ldquo;And I admit that I could
      give you no reason for my request, except that it all seemed so sudden.
      And&mdash;yes&mdash;there was one other thing. But that was even more
      silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I know what you mean,&rdquo; replied Richard, &ldquo;and I shall come to it
      presently. If any one was silly, it was not you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not sell Amalgamated Electric on Wednesday, and on Thursday a doubt
      about the increased dividend began to be circulated. The stock,
      nevertheless, after a forenoon of weakness, rallied. Moreover a check for
      my first dividend came from the Pollyopolis Heat, Light, Power, Paving,
      Pressing, and Packing Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What a number of things it does!&rsquo; exclaimed Ethel, when I showed her the
      company&rsquo;s check.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I replied, and quoted Browning to her: &lsquo;&rsquo;Twenty-nine Distinct
      damnations. One sure if the other fails.&rsquo; Beverly&rsquo;s mother has a lot of
      it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Ethel did not smile. &lsquo;Richard,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I do wish you had more
      investments with ordinary simple names, like New York and New Haven, or
      Chicago and Northwestern.&rsquo; And when I told her that I thought this was
      really unreasonable, she was firm. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like the
      names&mdash;not most of them, at least. Dutchess and Columbia Traction
      sounds pretty well; and besides that, of course one knows how successful
      these electric railways are. But take the Standard Egg Trust, and the
      Patent Pasteurised Infant Rubber Feeder Company.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why, Ethel!&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;those are both based upon great inventions,
      Mr. Beverly&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she interrupted me earnestly &lsquo;I know about those inventions, Richard,
      for I have procured the prospectuses. And I wish that I could have told
      you my own feeling about them before you bought any of the stock.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I do not think you can fully have taken it in, Ethel.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I trust that it may not have fully taken you in,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;Have you
      noticed what those stocks are selling for at present?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I had noticed this. I had paid 63 for Standard Egg, and it was
      now 48, while 11 was the price of Patent Pasteurized Feeder, for which I
      had paid 20. But this, Mr. Beverly assured me, was a normal and even
      healthy course for a new stock. &lsquo;Had they gone up too soon and too high,&rsquo; 
      he explained, &lsquo;I should have suspected some crooked manipulation and
      advised selling at once. But this indicates a healthy absorption
      preliminary to a natural rise. I should not dream of letting mother part
      with hers.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The basis of Standard Egg was not only a monopoly of all the hens in the
      United States, but a machine called a Separator, for telling the age and
      state of an egg by means of immersion in water. Perfectly good eggs sank
      fast and passed out through one distributor; fairly nice eggs did not
      reach the bottom, and were drawn off through another sluice, and so on.
      This saved the wages of the egg twirlers, whose method of candling eggs,
      as it was called, was far less rapid than the Separator. And when I
      learned that one house in St. Louis alone twirled 50,000 eggs in a day,
      the possible profits of the Egg Trust became clear to me. But they were
      not so clear to Ethel. She said that you could not monopolise hens. That
      they would always be laying eggs and putting it in the power of
      competitors to hatch them by incubators. Nor did she have confidence in
      the Pasteurised Feeder. &lsquo;Even if you get the parents to adopt it,&rsquo; she
      said, &lsquo;you cannot get the children. If they do not like the taste of the
      milk as it comes out of the bottle through the Feeder, they will simply
      not take it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;old Mrs. Beverly is holding on to hers.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I said this, Ethel sat with her mouth tight. Then she opened it and
      said: &lsquo;I hate that woman.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Hate her? Why, you have never so much as laid eyes on her.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is not at all necessary. I consider it indecent for a grey haired
      woman with grandchildren to be speculating in the stock market every week
      like a regular bull or bear.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every point in this outburst of Ethel&rsquo;s seemed to me so unwarrantable
      that I was quite dazed. I sat looking at her, and her eyes filled with
      tears. &lsquo;Oh Richard!&rsquo; she exclaimed, &lsquo;she will ruin you, and I hate her!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My dear Ethel,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;she will not. And only see how you are
      making it all up out of your head. You have never seen her, but you speak
      of her as a grey-haired grandmother.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She must be, Richard. You have told me that Mr. Beverly is a married man
      and about forty-five. No doubt he has older sisters and brothers. But if
      he has not, his mother can hardly be less than sixty-five, and he has
      probably been married for several years. He might easily have a daughter
      coming out, next winter, and a son at Harvard or Yale; and if their
      grandmother&rsquo;s hair is not grey, that is quite as unnatural as her
      speculating in monopolised eggs in this way at her age. She must be a very
      unladylike person.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel, I saw, was excited. Therefore I made no more point of her theories
      concerning the appearance and family circle of old Mrs. Beverly. But in
      justice to myself I felt obliged to remind her, first, that I was
      investing, not speculating, and second, that it was Mr. Beverly&rsquo;s advice I
      was following, and not that of his mother. &lsquo;Had he not spoken of her,&rsquo; I
      said, &lsquo;I should have remained unaware of her existence.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She is at the bottom of it all the same,&rsquo; said Ethel. &lsquo;Everything you
      have bought has been because she bought it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is not quite the right way to put it,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;I was willing to
      buy these securities because Mr. Beverly thought so highly of them that he
      felt justified in&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There is no use,&rsquo; interrupted Ethel, &lsquo;in our going round this circle as
      if we were a pair of squirrels. I do not ask you to hate that woman for my
      sake, but I cannot change my own feeling. Do you remember, Richard, about
      the City of Philippi Sewer Bonds? You did not want to buy them at first.
      You told me yourself that you thought new towns in Texas were apt to buzz
      suddenly and then die because all the people hurried away to some newer
      town and left the houses and stores standing empty. But Mr. Beverly&rsquo;s
      mother got some, and all your hesitation fled. And now I see that the
      Gulf, Galveston, and Little Rock is going to build a branch that may make
      Philippi a perfectly evaporated town. If you sold these bonds to-day, how
      much would you lose?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not enjoy telling Ethel how much, but I had to. &lsquo;Only fifteen
      thousand dollars,&rsquo; I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Only!&rsquo; said Ethel. &lsquo;Well, I hope his mother will lose a great deal more
      than that.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is seldom that Ethel taps her foot, but she had begun to tap it now;
      and this inclined me to avoid any attempt at a soothing reply, in the hope
      that silence might prove still more soothing, and that thus we might get
      away from old Mrs. Beverly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She cannot possibly be less than sixty-five,&rsquo; Ethel presently announced.
      &lsquo;And she is far more likely to be seventy.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it best to agree to any age that Ethel chose to give the old
      lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Do you suppose,&rsquo; Ethel continued, &lsquo;that she does it by telephone?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My dearest,&rsquo; I responded, &lsquo;he must do it all for her, of course, you
      know.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I doubt that very much, Richard. And she strikes me as being the sort of
      character for whom a mere telephone would not be enough excitement. The
      nerves of those people require more and more stimulants to give them any
      sensation at all. I believe that she sits in his private office and
      watches the ticker.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why not give her a ticker in her bedroom while you are about it, Ethel?&rsquo; 
      I suggested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Ethel could not smile. &lsquo;I think that is perfectly probable,&rsquo; she
      answered. And then, &lsquo;Oh, Richard, isn&rsquo;t it mean!&rsquo; At this I took her hand,
      and she&mdash;but again I abstain from dwelling upon those circumstances
      of the engaged which are familiar to you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The change of May into June, and the change of June into July, did not
      mellow Ethel&rsquo;s bitter feelings. I remember the day after Petunias
      defaulted on their interest that she exclaimed, &lsquo;I hope I shall never meet
      her!&rsquo; We always called Mr. Beverly&rsquo;s mother &lsquo;she&rsquo; now. &lsquo;For if I were to
      meet her,&rsquo; continued Ethel, &lsquo;I feel I should say something that I should
      regret. Oh, Richard, I suppose we shall have to give up that house on Park
      Avenue!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put a cheerful and even insular face on the matter, for I could not
      bear to see Ethel so depressed. But it was hard work for me. Some few of
      my investments were evidently good; but it always seemed as if it was into
      these that I had happened to put not much money, while the bulk of my
      fortune was entangled in the others. Besides the usual Midsummer faintness
      that overtakes the stock market, my own specialties were a good deal more
      than faint. On the 20th of August I took the afternoon train to spend my
      two weeks&rsquo; holiday at Lenox; and during much of the journey I gazed at the
      Wall Street edition of the afternoon paper that I had purchased as I came
      through the Grand Central Station. Ethel and I read it in the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I wonder what she&rsquo;s buying now?&rsquo; said Ethel, vindictively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t help feeling sorry for her,&rsquo; I answered, with as much of a
      smile as I could produce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is so unnecessary, Richard! She can easily afford to gratify her
      gambling instinct.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There you go, Ethel, inventing millions for her just as you invented
      grandchildren.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not at all. Unless she constantly had money lying idle, she could not
      take these continual plunges. She is an old woman with few expenses, and
      she lives well within her income. You would hear of her entertaining if it
      was otherwise. So instead of conservatively investing her surplus, she
      makes ducks and drakes of it in her son&rsquo;s office. Is he at Hyde Park now?&rsquo; 
      Hyde Park was where the old Beverly country seat had always been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;He went to Europe early last month.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very likely he took her with him. She is probably at Monte Carlo.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Scarcely in August, I fancy. And I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Ethel. I have been
      counting it up. She has lost twenty-four thousand dollars in the Standard
      Egg alone. It takes a good deal of surplus to stand that.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Serve her right,&rsquo; said Ethel &lsquo;And I would say so to her face.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;September brought freshness to the stock market but not to me. Mr.
      Beverly, like the well-to-do man that he was, remained away in Europe
      until October should require his presence as a guiding hand in the office.
      Thus was I left without his buoyant consolation in the face of my
      investments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Petunias were being adjusted on a four per cent basis; Dutchess and
      Columbia Traction was holding its own; I could not complain of Amalgamated
      Electric, though it was now lower than when I had bought it, while had I
      sold it on that Wednesday in May when Ethel begged me, before the
      increased dividend turned out a mistake, I should have made money. But
      Philippi Sewers were threatened; Pasteurised Feeders had been numb since
      June; Pollyopolis Heat, Light, Power, Paving, Pressing, and Packing was
      going to pass its quarterly dividend; and Standard Egg had gone down from
      63 to 7 1/8. My million dollars on paper now was worth in reality less
      than a quarter of that sum, and although we could still make both ends
      meet fairly well in some place where you wouldn&rsquo;t want to live, like
      Philadelphia, in New York we should drop into a pinched and dwarfed
      obscurity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say now, and I shall never forget, that Ethel during these gloomy
      weeks behaved much better than I did. The grayer the outlook became, the
      more words of hope and sense she seemed to find She reminded me that,
      after all my Uncle Godfrey&rsquo;s legacy had been a thing unlooked for,
      something out of my scheme of life that I had my youth, my salary and my
      writing; and that she would wait till she was as old at Mr. Beverly&rsquo;s
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the thought of that lady which brought from Ethel the only note of
      complaint she uttered in my presence during that whole dreary month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were spending Sunday with a house party at Hyde Park; and driving to
      church, we passed an avenue gate with a lodge. &lsquo;Rockhurst, sir,&rsquo; said the
      coachman. &lsquo;Whose place?&rsquo; I inquired. &lsquo;The old Beverly place, sir.&rsquo; Ethel
      heard him tell me this; and as we went on, we saw a carriage and pair
      coming down the avenue toward the gate with that look which horses always
      seem to have when they are taking the family to church on Sunday morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If I see her,&rsquo; said Ethel to me as we entered the door, &lsquo;I shall be
      unable to say my prayers.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But only young people came into the Beverly pew, and Ethel said her
      prayers and also sang the hymn and chants very sweetly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the service, we strolled together in the old and lovely grave yard
      before starting homeward. We had told them that we should prefer to walk
      back. The day was beautiful, and one could see a little blue piece of the
      river, sparkling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here is where they are all buried,&rsquo; said Ethel, and we paused before
      brown old headstones with Beverly upon them. &lsquo;Died 1750; died 1767,&rsquo; 
      continued Ethel, reading the names and inscriptions. &lsquo;I think one doesn&rsquo;t
      mind the idea of lying in such a place as this.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of the young people in the pew now came along the path. &lsquo;The
      grandchildren,&rsquo; said Ethel. &lsquo;She is probably too old to come to church. Or
      she is in Europe.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young people had brought a basket with flowers from their place, and
      now laid them over several of the grassy mounds. &lsquo;Give me some of yours,&rsquo; 
      said one to the other, presently; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve not enough for grandmother&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel took me rather sharply by the arm. &lsquo;Did you hear that?&rsquo; she asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be she, you know,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;He would have come back from
      Europe.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we found it out at lunch. It was she, and she had been dead for
      fifteen years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ethel and I talked it over in the train going up to town on Monday
      morning. We had by that time grown calmer. &lsquo;If it is not false pretences,&rsquo; 
      said she, &lsquo;and you cannot sue him for damages, and if it is not stealing
      or something, and you cannot put him in prison, what are you going to do
      to him, Richard?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As this was a question which I had frequently asked myself during the
      night, having found no satisfactory answer to it, I said: &lsquo;What would you
      do in my place, Ethel?&rsquo; But Ethel knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I should find out when he sails, and meet his steamer with a cowhide.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then he would sue me for damages.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That would be nothing, if you got a few good cuts in on him.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ethel,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;please follow me carefully. I should like dearly to
      cowhide him. and for the sake of argument we will consider it done Then
      comes the lawsuit. Then I get up and say that I beat him because he made
      me buy Standard Egg at 63 by telling me that his mother had some, when
      really the old lady had been dead for fifteen years. When I think of it in
      this way, I do not feel&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rsquo; interrupted Ethel, &lsquo;you are afraid of ridicule. All men are.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had Ethel insisted, I believe that I should have cowhided Mr. Beverly for
      her sake. But before his return our destinies were brightened. Copper had
      been found near Ethel&rsquo;s waste lands in Michigan, and the family business
      man was able to sell the property for seven hundred thousand dollars. He
      did this so promptly that I ventured to ask him if delay might not have
      brought a greater price. &lsquo;Well&rsquo;, he said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. You must seize
      these things. Blake and Beverly might have got tired waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Blake and Beverly!&rsquo; I exclaimed &lsquo;So they made the purchase. It Mr.
      Beverly back?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Just back. To tell the truth I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re finding so much
      copper as they hoped.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This turned out to be true. And I am not sure that the business man had
      not known it all the while. &lsquo;We looked over the property pretty thoroughly
      at the time of the Tamarack excitement,&rsquo; he said. And in a few days more,
      in fact, it was generally known that this land had returned to its old
      state of not quite paying the taxes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I paid my visit to Mr. Beverly, but with no cowhide. &lsquo;Mr. Beverly,&rsquo; 
      said I, &lsquo;I want to announce to you my engagement to Miss Ethel Lansing,
      whose Michigan copper land you have lately acquired. I hope that you
      bought some for your mother.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Richard Field, &ldquo;are the circumstances attending my
      engagement which I felt might interest you. And now, Ethel, tell your
      story, if they&rsquo;ll listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; said Ethel, &ldquo;that is the story I was going to tell.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
